# Learn DevOps

Learn the craft of "DevOps" (Developer Operations)
to _easily/reliably_ deploy your App and keep it Up!

## Why?

You should learn more "advanced" DevOps if:

+ You / your team have "out-grown"
[Heroku](https://github.com/dwyl/learn-heroku)
(_e.g: your Heroku bill is more than $100/month_)
+ You want "more control" over your infrastructure
+ Your client/boss has instructed you to use a _specific_ "cloud" provider.

## What?

"Advanced" Deployment for your apps

## Who?

Anyone who wants to _seriously consider/call_ themself
a "***Full Stack***" **Developer** ***must*** know how to deploy,
secure and monitor their app on their chosen infrastructure.



## How?

> good question ...!
