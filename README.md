## Why?

You should learn more "advanced" DevOps if:

+ You / your team have "out-grown"
[Heroku](https://github.com/dwyl/learn-heroku)
(_e.g: your Heroku bill is more than $100/month_)
+ You want "more control" over your infrastructure
+ Your client/boss has instructed you to use a _specific_ "cloud" provider.

## What?

> "_DevOps integrates developers and operations teams

a "***Full Stack***" **Developer** ***must*** know how to deploy,
secure and monitor their app on their chosen infrastructure.
