# Learn DevOps

Learn the craft of "DevOps" (Developer Operations)
to _easily/reliably_ deploy your App and keep it Up!

## Why?

You should learn more "advanced" DevOps if:

+ You / your team have "out-grown"
[Heroku](https://github.com/dwyl/learn-heroku)
(_e.g: your Heroku bill is more than $100/month_)
+ You want "more control" over your infrastructure
e.g: to run a specific version of software or database.
+ Your client/boss has instructed you
to use a _specific_ "cloud" provider.
+ Curiosity to extend your
"back end infrastructure" knowledge to be a more
"well-rounded" developer.

## What?

> "_DevOps integrates developers and operations teams
> in order to improve collaboration and productivity
> by automating infrastructure, automating workflows
> and continuously measuring application performance._"
> from: ["**What is DevOps**?"](https://youtu.be/_I94-tJlovg) by RackSpace

## Who?

Everyone that wants to _seriously consider/call_ themself
a "***Full Stack***" **Developer** ***must*** know how to deploy,
secure and monitor their app on their chosen infrastructure.


## How?

>> Use Vagrant to Automate Infrastructure Deployment on Linode

### Using a Different Cloud Infrastructure Provider?

While this tutorial has focussed on using Linode,
we @dwyl have _experience_ of using _several_ infrastructure providers:

+ Amazon Web Services: https://github.com/dwyl/learn-amazon-web-services
+ Azure: https://github.com/dwyl/learn-microsoft-azure
+ Digital Ocean: https://github.com/dwyl/DigitalOcean-Setup
+ Heroku: https://github.com/dwyl/learn-heroku

if you have a question specific to using Linode or one of the _other_
"cloud" providers, please
[**open an _issue_**](https://github.com/dwyl/learn-devops/issues)
and we will attempt to help!
